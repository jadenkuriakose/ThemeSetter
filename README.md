Developed a simple React.js template for use in future projects that includes a theme change button set up in App.js and App.css.
Designed buttons and animations in the App.css file and eventually pushed it as a template to possibly use later on for convenience.
Can be used by other programmers who want to include themes in their project and can be very easily integrated to other react and HTML/CSS projects.
